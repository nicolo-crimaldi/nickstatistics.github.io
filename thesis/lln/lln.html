            <h2>Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN)</h2>
            <p>The Weak Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size of a random variable increases, the sample mean converges in probability to the population mean.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, for a sequence of random variables X₁, X₂, X₃, ..., which are i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) with a finite mean (μ) and variance (σ²), the weak law can be expressed as:</p>

            <p>For any ε &gt; 0:</p>
            <p>lim<span style="vertical-align: sub;">(n → ∞)</span> P(|(X̄n - μ)| &lt; ε) = 1</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Proof of Weak Law of Large Numbers</h3>
            <p>The proof of the Weak Law of Large Numbers is based on Chebyshev's inequality and properties of expectations and variances. Let's outline the key steps of the proof:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Start with the Chebyshev inequality:</li>
                <p>P(|X - E[X]| &ge; ε) ≤ Var(X) / ε²</p>

                <li>Apply Chebyshev to the sample mean X̄n:</li>
                <p>P(|X̄n - μ| &ge; ε) ≤ Var(X̄n) / ε²</p>

                <li>Use properties of expectations and variances:</li>
                <p>Var(X̄n) = Var(X) / n</p>

                <li>Substitute this into the inequality:</li>
                <p>P(|X̄n - μ| &ge; ε) ≤ Var(X) / (nε²)</p>

                <li>Take the limit as n → ∞:</li>
                <p>lim<span style="vertical-align: sub;">(n → ∞)</span> P(|X̄n - μ| &ge; ε) = 0</p>
            </ol>

            <p>Thus, the Weak Law of Large Numbers is proved, showing that as n increases, the probability of X̄n being close to μ approaches 1.</p>

            <h2>Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)</h2>
            <p>The Strong Law of Large Numbers is a stronger version of the law, stating that the sample mean converges almost surely to the population mean as the sample size increases.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, for the same sequence of i.i.d. random variables X₁, X₂, X₃, ..., the strong law can be expressed as:</p>

            <p>P(lim<span style="vertical-align: sub;">(n → ∞)</span> X̄n = μ) = 1</p>

            <h3 class="mt-3">Proof of Strong Law of Large Numbers</h3>
            <p>The proof of the Strong Law of Large Numbers is more intricate and typically involves advanced probability theory and measure theory. The key concept in this proof is the Borel-Cantelli lemmas and Kolmogorov's zero-one law. Here's a simplified outline:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Define events A₁, A₂, A₃, ...:</li>
                <p>Aₙ = {lim<span style="vertical-align: sub;">(n → ∞)</span> X̄n = μ}</p>

                <li>Apply Borel-Cantelli lemma:</li>
                <p>If Σ P(Aₙ) &lt; ∞, then P(lim Aₙ) = 0</p>

                <li>Prove Σ P(Aₙ) &lt; ∞:</li>
                <p>This step involves using Kolmogorov's zero-one law, and it requires detailed probability theory.

                <li>Conclude that lim Aₙ = μ almost surely:</li>
                <p>Since Σ P(Aₙ) &lt; ∞, it implies that lim Aₙ = μ almost surely.</p>
            </ol>

            <p>These laws are fundamental in probability theory and statistics, providing the theoretical basis for the reliability of sample means as estimators of population means.</p>

            <h2>Simulations</h2>
            <p>
                We can simulate babies’ weights with independent normal random variables, mean 3 kg and standard
                deviation 0.5 kg. The following R commands perform this simulation and computes a running average of the heights.
