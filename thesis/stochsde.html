        <p>A stochastic process is any process describing the evolution in time of a random phenomenon. biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics, image processing, signal processing, control theory, information theory, computer science, and telecommunications. </p>

            Formal definition
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 math">
            A stochastic process is defined as a sequence of random variables on a common probability space \((\Omega, F, P)\) where \(\Omega \) is the sample space, F is a \(\sigma\)-algebra and P is a probability measure. The random variables indexed by some index set \(T\) (often the time) take values in a space \(S\) which is measurable respect to some \(\sigma\)-algebra
        </p>
        <p>
            So for the given parameters a stochastic process can be written as: 
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            \[
            \{X(t):t\in T\}
            \]
        </p>

            Stochastic processes classification:
        </p>

        <p>
            A stochastic process can be classified under two main categories:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="lead">Discrete time stochastic processes</span>
                    An example can be represented by random walks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="lead">Continuous time stochastic processes</span>
                    An example can be represented by brownian motions.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <p class="h3">
            Stochastic differential equations
        </p>
        <p>
            A stochastic differential equation is a classical differential equation but it's perturbed by some random noise.
        </p>
        <p class="math">\[ dX_t = \mu(t, X_t) \, dt + \sigma(t, X_t) \, dW_t \]</p>

        <p>Here, \(X_t\) is the stochastic process, \(\mu(t, X_t)\) is the drift term, \(\sigma(t, X_t)\) is the diffusion term, \(dt\) represents the differential of time, and \(dW_t\) represents the differential of a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion).</p>
        <p class="math">
            For given functions and a brownian motion \(W_t\), the solution to this equation is a function \(X\) that satisfies the following:
            \[
            X(T) = \int_{0}^{T} \mu(t, X(t))dt + \int_{0}^{T} \sigma(t, X(t)) dW(t)
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            More in general, differential equation have common terms like:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b class="math">Drift term: \(\mu(t, X_t)\)</b> represents the deterministic part of the change in the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="math">Diffusion term: \(\sigma(t, X_t)\)</b> represents the random part of the change.
                </li>
            </ul>
